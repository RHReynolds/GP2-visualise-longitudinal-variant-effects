## Project description
Take results from biomarker GWAS and create a tool that allows researchers to be able to go in an query for a particular biomarker and get a visualisation of the effect on all, or a set, of cohorts, as well as the associated meta-analysis. Add the ability to display longitudinal information alongside cross-sectional results.
